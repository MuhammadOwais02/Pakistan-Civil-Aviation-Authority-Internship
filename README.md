# Internship Project: Data Augmentation and Automated Email Attachments Files downloading and Sorting

Welcome to my repository that documents my internship project at the Head Quarters Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority's IT department. In this project, I will be working on data augmentation of flight plans ('.txt' attachments on local email server) and automated sorting of files.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this internship project is to enhance the flight plan data by applying data augmentation techniques. Additionally, I will be developing a system prototype to automatically download attachments and sort those files based on file extentions, improving the efficiency of file management. And in Phase II, the files of a certain extention '.txt' will be prcessed one-by-one and stored in excel file.

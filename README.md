# Internship Project: Flight Plan Data Augmentation and Automated File Sorting

Welcome to my repository that documents my internship project at the Head Quarters Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority's IT department. In this project, I have been working on data augmentation of flight plans and automated sorting of files.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this internship project is to enhance the flight plan data by applying data augmentation techniques. Additionally, I have developed a system to automatically sort files based on certain criteria, improving the efficiency of file management within the organization.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `data_augmentation/`: This directory contains the code and documentation related to the flight plan data augmentation. It includes scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and any relevant data files.

- `automated_file_sorting/`: This directory contains the code and documentation for the automated file sorting system. It includes scripts, configuration files, and any necessary dependencies.

- `docs/`: This directory holds any additional documentation or notes related to the project. It may include research papers, design diagrams, or any other relevant information.
